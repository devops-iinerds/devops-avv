> ### *The manifest is a specification of a Kubernetes API object in JSON or YAML format. A manifest specifies the desired state of an object that Kubernetes will maintain when you apply the manifest.*

### pod.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

> ### *Required Fields*

In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:

- apiVersion - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
- kind - What kind of object you want to create
- metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
- spec - What state you desire for the object. In the case of a pod, itâ€™s where you describe the state of your container


> ### *To get detailed output with neat explanation of each kind:*

```
$kubectl api-resources -o wide
```

> ### *Now, we could dig more into the APIs and their kind values via kubectl explain*

KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

DESCRIPTION:
     Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is
     created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

FIELDS:
   apiVersion	<string>
     APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an
     object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal
     value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

   kind	<string>
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

   metadata	<Object>
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

   spec	<Object>
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

   status	<Object>
     Most recently observed status of the pod. This data may not be up to date.
     Populated by the system. Read-only. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

FIELD:    kind <string>

DESCRIPTION:
     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
     represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
     requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: metadata <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Standard object's metadata. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

     ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which
     includes all objects users must create.

FIELDS:
   annotations	<map[string]string>
     Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that
     may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They
     are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More
     info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

   clusterName	<string>
     The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to
     distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters.
     This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore
     it if set in create or update request.

   creationTimestamp	<string>
     CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this
     object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order
     across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is
     represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

     Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

   deletionGracePeriodSeconds	<integer>
     Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it
     will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also
     set. May only be shortened. Read-only.

   deletionTimestamp	<string>
     DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be
     deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is
     requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The
     resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists,
     and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
     finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items,
     deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not
     be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or
     the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may
     request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by

KIND:     Pod
VERSION:  v1

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod. More info:
     https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#spec-and-status

     PodSpec is a description of a pod.

FIELDS:
   activeDeadlineSeconds	<integer>
     Optional duration in seconds the pod may be active on the node relative to
     StartTime before the system will actively try to mark it failed and kill
     associated containers. Value must be a positive integer.

   affinity	<Object>
     If specified, the pod's scheduling constraints

   automountServiceAccountToken	<boolean>
     AutomountServiceAccountToken indicates whether a service account token
     should be automatically mounted.

   containers	<[]Object> -required-
     List of containers belonging to the pod. Containers cannot currently be
     added or removed. There must be at least one container in a Pod. Cannot be
     updated.

   dnsConfig	<Object>
     Specifies the DNS parameters of a pod. Parameters specified here will be
     merged to the generated DNS configuration based on DNSPolicy.

   dnsPolicy	<string>
     Set DNS policy for the pod. Defaults to "ClusterFirst". Valid values are
     'ClusterFirstWithHostNet', 'ClusterFirst', 'Default' or 'None'. DNS
     parameters given in DNSConfig will be merged with the policy selected with
     DNSPolicy. To have DNS options set along with hostNetwork, you have to
     specify DNS policy explicitly to 'ClusterFirstWithHostNet'.



   enableServiceLinks	<boolean>
     EnableServiceLinks indicates whether information about services should be
     injected into pod's environment variables, matching the syntax of Docker
     links. Optional: Defaults to true.

   ephemeralContainers	<[]Object>
     List of ephemeral containers run in this pod. Ephemeral containers may be
     run in an existing pod to perform user-initiated actions such as debugging.
